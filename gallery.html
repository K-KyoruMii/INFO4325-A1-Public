        <h3>Kyoru's OC Summer Stand Project</h3>
        This is a personal project that was started for several reasons, but me
        missing out on some convention exclusive merchandise was the prime
        factor. The final goal of this project is to draw out a bunch of acrylic
        stand designs for myself and friends. Below is an album containing the
        first 3 summer stands I've made so far! (I <i>would</i> post more of
        these, but I would need to get permission to use my friends' original
        characters, so it's just gonna be these three.) <br /><br />
