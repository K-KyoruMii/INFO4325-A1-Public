        <h3>Kyoru's OC Summer Stand Project</h3>
        This is a personal project that was started for several reasons, but me
        missing out on some convention exclusive merchandise was the prime
        factor. The final goal of this project is to draw out a bunch of acrylic
        stand designs for myself and friends. Below is an album containing the
        first 3 summer stands I've made so far! (I <i>would</i> post more of
        these, but I would need to get permission to use my friends' original
        characters, so it's just gonna be these three.) <br /><br />

        <h3>Game Screenshots and Mockups</h3>
        Below are some screenshots and mockups from Magic 8 Burrito and Fading
        Steel, showing off the UI designs and art I've made for the games:<br /><br />
        <h4>Magic 8 Burrito</h4>
        Please note that the character art was drawn by
        <a href="rabu-nee.carrd.co">rabu-nee</a>. <br />
        I merely made the UI elements for the visuals.<br />
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NdP0K3S.png" title="8Burrito" alt="8B" />
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Fading Steel</h4>
        As the sole artist and animator at Team Crankshaft, I was in charge of
        pretty much everything visually. <br />
        On top of these WIP screens, animations I made for the game can be found
        here at my
        <a href="https://imgur.com/a/t9QDPq6">Animation Gallery</a><br /><br />

        <h3>My Cooking</h3>
        I like experimenting with recipes that catch my interest, since a lot of
        the food I take interest in is either really hard to find or outright
        unavailable where I live... or it's just expensive. <br /><br />
        <h4>Schweinshaxe</h4>
        German roasted pork knuckles. Commonly sold at the Night Market, but it
        got pricy, so I started making my own.<br /><br />

        /><br /><br />
        <h4>Chicken Cream Stew</h4>
        A recipe I learned from a game. It's a bit thicker than usual cream
        stews.<br /><br />

          width="840"
        /><br /><br />
        <h4>Griddle Fried Salmon</h4>
        I recently got a new griddle at the time I made this, so I decided to
        use it to cook up an entire salmon.<br /><br />

        /><br /><br />
        <h4>Chicken and Sausage Gumbo</h4>
        Before my family stopped buying Campbell soup cans, I came to like the
        flavour of chicken and sausage gumbo. I recently started missing it, so
        I started making my own. The first time ended up being so spicy, no one
        could eat it until I added cheese to it.<br /><br />
