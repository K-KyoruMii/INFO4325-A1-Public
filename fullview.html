        <h2>Welcome to my web page!</h2>

        <p>
          Name's Kyo~ I'm an artist who specializes in drawing with a
          manga-inspired art style and designing very detailed mechanical
          weaponry for fun! (Provided I'm not distracted with games.)<br />
          <br />
          As of right now, I'm studying IT while learning how to make games and
          forming the occasional team to make them. Aside from that, I also also
          cook for a hobby. <br />
          <br />
          If any of this interests you, I have a gallery that you can access
          from the navigation bar on the left or further down below!<br><br>

          <h2>Gallery</h2>

          <p>
            In here, you'll find a gallery of some of my more recent works, as
            well as some pics of the food I've made.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Kyoru's OC Summer Stand Project</h3>
          This is a personal project that was started for several reasons, but me
          missing out on some convention exclusive merchandise was the prime
          factor. The final goal of this project is to draw out a bunch of acrylic
          stand designs for myself and friends. Below is an album containing the
          first 3 summer stands I've made so far! (I <i>would</i> post more of
          these, but I would need to get permission to use my friends' original
          characters, so it's just gonna be these three.) <br /><br />

          <h3>Game Screenshots and Mockups</h3>
          Below are some screenshots and mockups from Magic 8 Burrito and Fading
          Steel, showing off the UI designs and art I've made for the games:<br /><br />
          <h4>Magic 8 Burrito</h4>
          Please note that the character art was drawn by
          <a href="rabu-nee.carrd.co">rabu-nee</a>. <br />
          I merely made the UI elements for the visuals.<br />
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NdP0K3S.png" title="8Burrito" alt="8B" />
          <br /><br />
          <h4>Fading Steel</h4>
          As the sole artist and animator at Team Crankshaft, I was in charge of
          pretty much everything visually. <br />
          On top of these WIP screens, animations I made for the game can be found
          here at my
          <a href="https://imgur.com/a/t9QDPq6">Animation Gallery</a><br /><br />

          <h3>My Cooking</h3>
          I like experimenting with recipes that catch my interest, since a lot of
          the food I take interest in is either really hard to find or outright
          unavailable where I live... or it's just expensive. <br /><br />
          <h4>Schweinshaxe</h4>
          German roasted pork knuckles. Commonly sold at the Night Market, but it
          got pricy, so I started making my own.<br /><br />

            width="840"
          /><br /><br />
          <h4>Chicken Cream Stew</h4>
          A recipe I learned from a game. It's a bit thicker than usual cream
          stews.<br /><br />
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/ruxkPIT.jpeg"

            alt="stew"
            width="840"
          /><br /><br />
          <h4>Griddle Fried Salmon</h4>
          I recently got a new griddle at the time I made this, so I decided to
          use it to cook up an entire salmon.<br /><br />
          <img

            alt="salmon"
            width="840"
          /><br /><br />
          <h4>Chicken and Sausage Gumbo</h4>
          Before my family stopped buying Campbell soup cans, I came to like the
          flavour of chicken and sausage gumbo. I recently started missing it, so
          I started making my own. The first time ended up being so spicy, no one
          could eat it until I added cheese to it.<br /><br />

          <h2>Games I've Worked On</h2>

          <p>
            Over my time at KPU, I've worked on several games and collaborated
            with artists I've met online to bring a few of my ideas to life in
            game format.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Magic 8-Burrito</h3>
          My first collaboration project with
          <a href="rabu-nee.carrd.co">rabu-nee</a>. This is a triple purpose
          "magic 8 ball" app written in Processing 4 with help from rabu, who
          helped me figure out the bugs and also provided the character art. My
          own art contributions comprised of just the clouds and the button art
          due to the limited time I had to complete this game. <br /><br />
  
          <h3>Fading Steel: Tactical Firearms Operations</h3>
          An in-development point and clock shooting game by Team Crankshaft where
          I am serving as the main artist and graphic designer. Development is
          currently on hold due to the main programmer being unavailable at the
          time of writing. Mockups can be found on the gallery page! <br /><br />
  
          <h3>Knight's Quest: Hunter and Rune</h3>
          A JRPG that ended up being a failed project. The original version of
          Hunter's Quest was written in Processing 4, but countless problems
          during development caused the project to fall apart. KQ:H&R is currently
          a planned project with <a href="rabu-nee.carrd.co">rabu-nee</a> to make
          an expanded remake using a JRPG game engine; introducing new ideas and
          more fleshed out animations.
