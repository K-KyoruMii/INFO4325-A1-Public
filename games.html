        <h2>Games I've Worked On</h2>

        <p>
          Over my time at KPU, I've worked on several games and collaborated
          with artists I've met online to bring a few of my ideas to life in
          game format.
        </p>

        <h3>Magic 8-Burrito</h3>
        My first collaboration project with rabu-nee. This is a triple purpose
        "magic 8 ball" app written in Processing 4 with help from rabu, who
        helped me figure out the bugs and also provided the character art. My
        own art contributions comprised of just the clouds and the button art
        due to the limited time I had to complete this game. <br /><br />

        <h3>Fading Steel: Tactical Firearms Operations</h3>
        An in-development point and clock shooting game by Team Crankshaft where
        I am serving as the main artist and graphic designer. Development is
        currently on hold due to the main programmer being unavailable at the
        time of writing. Mockups can be found on the gallery page! <br /><br />

        <h3>Knight's Quest: Hunter and Rune</h3>
        A JRPG that ended up being a failed project. The original version of
        Hunter's Quest was written in Processing 4, but countless problems
        during development caused the project to fall apart. KQ:H&R is currently
        a planned project with rabu-nee to make an expanded remake using a JRPG
        game engine; introducing new ideas and more fleshed out animations.
